// Package report pushes what the operator sees to the Fleet control plane.
//
// It exists because of P7. The control plane must not import client-go, or the
// gateway stops being usable outside a cluster; so the control plane cannot
// read Nodes and Deployments itself. The operator is the only component allowed
// to know what Kubernetes is, which makes it the only component that can
// produce an inventory report. The control plane receives the result over HTTP
// and never learns what produced it.
